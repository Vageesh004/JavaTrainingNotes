Java Training - Notes Day 29



npm install typescript

npm init -y ----> package.json

npx tsc --init --> tsconfig.json  ----> before this one also the appln runs


Then, give  npx tsc hello.ts

Then js file also gets created and compiled


Then give npx node hello.js



Instead of 2 commands, give one command

npx tsx hello.ts



Then, for nodemon ,


Arrays and Tuples:





Commands:


npm install typescript

npm init -y ----> package.json

npx tsc --init --> tsconfig.json  ----> before this one also the appln runs

Then, give  npx tsc hello.ts



   For Nodemon:


   npm install -g nodemon


   npx nodemon -exec npx tsx arrays.ts


   

   Then, npm i -D nodemon tsx

  -D means development env


 Then, in package.json, under the scripts: we are giving "run": "nodemon --exec npx tsx".... 
For this, execution command in terminal is npx run <filename> 

If not run and we use start, 

"start": nodemon --exec npx tsx


npm start <filename>



Then watch mode also there... to watch , like debug mode


For continous execution of the application, we need nodemon... Like DevTools of SpringBoot



TypeScript:


npm install -g typescript



Enums run command:

npx run file.ts




Angular:


Components:

For compoenets, install angular extension service



One-way binding

Two-way binding



In Angular, we use class components, there in React, we used functional components



Property Binding -> ()

event binding

myModel 

twoway binding


Both Event and Property binding are one-way binding


The Angular and React both are SPA.. no reloading, only rendering??









Prgm 1:

let - block scope


Prgm 2:

User Defined class

2 methods: Constructor without parameters and constructor with parameters


we can use any one constructor only in the prgm...we can't use both at a time..

Like Java JVM we can't us like this here...





Prgm 1:


demoOnTuples.ts


let person:[number,string]=[123,"amit"];

let personss:[number,string][]=[[234,"swapna"],[567,"keerthi"],[456,"vikky"]];

console.log(person)
console.log(personss)

let arr=new Array<number>(5).fill(0)

let student={
    name:"ajay",id:345
}
//let mynums:[56,78] as const
let mynums=Object.freeze ([12,34])
let mynumsarr:number []=[12,345,567]

console.log(mynumsarr)
console.log(mynums)



Prgm 2:

dem




Afternoon:

One-way binding

Two-way binding


One-way: html to forms or reverse

Two-way: through NgModel, forms module
