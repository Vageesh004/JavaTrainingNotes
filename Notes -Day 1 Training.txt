Notes :  17/11/25: Day 1: Java FSD

Git:

Commands:

git config --global user.name "Vageeshs004"

git config --global user.email "vageesh.smd@gmail.com"

git init

git remote add origin "that link from GitHub"

git commit -m "that msg"


git branch

git status... if it is on master and u want to change to main,
give   git branch -M main  (or)  git checkout main


git 











Concept 3 :  create another branch and push that also

git branch 


When collaborative projects we do, 




when we delete a branch in cmd 




Ruleset rules we should for merge: change something mentioned..then only we can merge to main



Here, create a new branch..  

git checkout -b vageesh-branch (it checkouts from the old branch and creates a new branch called vageesh-branch)

git add Clone.txt

git commit -m "new branch"

git branch

git push origin vageesh-branch


then, one pop-up will show.. give pull and merge request... then give pull request.. add comments..then merge request..then commit

then it will be  updated in Clone.txt



To delete that branch, mam told, first delete in GitHub website.. then do on local or else it won't be deleted as it is active

but, we can do in terminal itself

give  git checkout main (active branch goes to main ) - mam told create a new branch and then delete the vageesh-branch

but, we can go to main branch itself..   then (git pull origin main) - i don't know why it is for



then give, git branch -d vageesh-branch

git push origin --delete vageesh-branch




Concept 4 : Collaborative repository:

the owner adds other members


you clone the repository that owner added you and add a file onto it and push it

then, the owner changes in Branches.... activate... set target as default... select pull request before merging.. and increase the count to something...then save..

then , also, owner adds some other things...in branches..





-------------------------Database and SQL--------------------

RDBMS:  we are managing 2 or 3 tables having relations using structured query language... so it is called Relational Data base

Flat-file - simple csv file or excel file


Hierarchial model

Xml model 

2 ways to transfer data over network - json and xml



Components of RDBMS:


2. Softwares

3. Data

4. Users - DBA, devolopers, end users

5. Procedures





3.Levels of DBMS Architecture:

External level - user view

Conceptual level - logical schema

Internal level - Physical storage 

Hardware side..

we require only conceptual and external level.





5.Procedures - we don't bother this

6. SQL




Normalization: 

MySQL Workbench:  


show databases;

create database demo;

use demo;
create table employee (empid numeric(15), empname varchar(50), designation varchar(50), 
mobile varchar(10), address varchar(30),salary numeric(10));

show tables;

desc employee;

insert into employee values(123,'Vageesh','Java','7010577421', 'Trichy',40000);
select * from employee;


Primary key and Unique key difeerences:

Primary key cannot be null , unique key can be null

There may be many unique keys but there will be only one primary key





alter table employee add constraint pk primary key (empid);  // error will come when there is redundant data.. it will say pk will not be able to make when redundant data is there..


so, give

delete from employee where empid=123;

set SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;



DML and DDL: DML - insert, update,delete etc.



First Normal Form:


Second normal form: No Partial dependencies



First normal form:  If some columns are there in table and if one columns has may values, like 2 or 3 phone numbers, then, we separately write the data with one phone number and other phone no separately..

single table row 



Primary key:
Foreign key:
Composite key:
Candidate key:

Unique key:

Super key:
Surrogate key:

Alternative key:



Question: Create a student table with student Id, Course Id, studname coursename 



Second normal Form: No Partial dependency on composite key

Write Course table separately, student table separately, then comined one table with composite primary keys..


Composite key: 2 attributes or more combinely form a primary key... not a single attribute can define the row uniquely..

Alternate key: other than primary key, the other columns that will uniquely identify the rows are called Alternate key...


Candidate key: primary key + alternate key

Super key: Super set of all keys.

like name alone
name + email
name + phone number

It is like power set of all subsets






How to add a folder in GitHub:

We can't add directly.. go on add new file search button , give nov17/ 

when we give slash, new folder will be created


then add the homework files of the day on your repo



create table Student (studid numeric,courseid numeric, studname varchar(15), coursename varchar(20));

alter table student add column marks numeric;

insert into student values (123,1,'swapna','java',90);
insert into student values (123,2,'swapna','spring',90);
insert into student values (124,1,'swapna','java',90);

insert into student values (125,1,'swathi','java',95);

alter table student add constraint spk primary key (studid,courseid);

create table student_2nf (studid numeric,studname varchar(15));
alter table student_2nf add constraint spk2nf primary key(studid);

create table course_2nf (course numeric primary key, coursename varchar(10));
alter table course_2nf add constraint spk2nf primary key(courseid);

create table student_course_2nf (studid numeric, courseid numeric, marks numeric, primary key(studid,courseid));
