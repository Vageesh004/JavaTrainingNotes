 Java Training: Nov 21

Day 5

Java :

Regex101 - website for learning abt Regular Expression



Question 2: Switch case to finish simple calculator

Learnt about Sonar lint --if possible - code coverage tool

Question 3:


Qn :
print your name until you give 'No'



------------Maven-------:

Standalone Appln - means on that system only it will work



QuickStart
and Web App

for some Build Success, for some, plugins build error came

Project -> right click -> maven build -> Goals: clean install

Then, build success will come..

give alt f5, force update, ok..


There is a parent class called object class.

Wait , notify and many other methods will be there




Inheritence:

-> extends

---> Multiple inheritence is not possible in Java


-> Object class is like parent cls to all classes


SA and Current Account



If the getter setter are not in child class, JVM will search and get from the parent class



System class has 3 objects... in , out , err


Virtual polymorphism: when Jvm is working on runtime, if definition or signature of the parent and child class is same, it decides whether to go to parent class or child class.. 

It is called Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Polymorphism..



Abstract class: 

If a method is abstract , then the class is definitely abstract..

Normal classes does n't have abstract methods..



Current Account Menu:

1.checkdetails

2. checkOverdraft limit

3. withdraw

4. deposit

5. reset pin or change pin

6. Generate pin



Menu:

1.Saving Account

2. Current Account


Savings Account menu:




Trying to push maven project to GitHub:

Right click, team, commit.. , write commit msg..then commit and push..

then in githhub account, developer settings, new classic key.. create one and copy





JVM Supplies the default constructor when we do not provide any.


All the static blocks will be executed first before the main method

why we have created main as a static method??








Question:  Create a college class inside a Student class... Inner cls creation



Interfaces:

Multiple inheritance is not possible in Java..

but through Interface it is possible..



final - it is constant... it can be applied through class level, method level.. local variable too... only modifier that can be in local.

final class can't be extended.. method cannot be overridden..




p s v m(String args[]){
	A a=new A();
	a.display();

	B b=new B();
	b.display();

	C c=new C();
	c.display();

	a=b;
	a.display();

	a=c;
	a.display();
}      // Dynamic Binding

 
Dynamic binding means, at runtime only, we come to know which one that a.display is referring...


Another Dynamic Binding prgm:

package com.nov21.Day1MavenProject;

public interface Interface1 {
	public default void sayHello() {
		System.out.println("From Interface1 sayhello");
	}
}


package com.nov21.Day1MavenProject;

public interface Interface2 {
	public default void sayHello() {
		System.out.println("From Interface2 sayHello");
	}
}



package com.nov21.Day1MavenProject;

public class Class1 implements Interface1,Interface2{
	@Override
	public void sayHello() {
		//to avoid diamond problem, we go to interface related sayHello method
		Interface2.super.sayHello();
	}
	
	public static void main(String args[]) {
	
	Class1 c1=new Class1();
	c1.sayHello();
	
	//Interface does not have objects...can't put new here
	Interface1 i1=new Class1();
	i1.sayHello();
	
	Interface2 i2=new Class1();
	i2.sayHello();
	
	}
}


------------Strings-----------

For every String, there is a permeanant object space..
for every change, there is a new object space allocated..

For this only, we don't use Strings that much...so we use StringBuffer and StringBuilder..




package com.nov21.Day1MavenProject;

public class StringMain {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		String s="hello";
		System.out.println(s.hashCode());
		s="helloworld";
		
		System.out.println(s.hashCode());
		String s1="hello";
		
		System.out.println(s1.hashCode());
		
		String s2=new String("hello");
		System.out.println(s2.hashCode());
		
		System.out.println(s.length());
		System.out.println(s.indexOf('w'));
		
		String s3="Mphasis";
		s2.concat(s3);
		System.out.println(s2);  //it will not change s2 or s3..
		//the result is a 3 rd object, Hello Mphasis
		
		System.out.println(s1==s2); //false ..this is reference..this is address
		//this would be different
		
		System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); //value comparison.. this is same...
		
		System.out.println(s.substring(5,10));  //starting to ending index
		
		// s1 and s2 are addresses stored in stack
		//so they are different..
		//but s1.equals(s2) means.. they refer to the same variable area 
		//i.e hello stored in the heap
		
		
		
	}

}




Today's class Overview:


Morning:
Prime nos

Do while , while loop prgm 

Reverse no

switch case



Morning after break:

That maven project downloaded.. build success came... then, 

that 

 Afternoon:

Tried to use Lombok..but not able to 

Then , prgm on ComplexNumbers was done

Then, in App.java, s1.hashCode(), s2.hashCode() were done

Then, using static blocks


Afternoon after break:

Interface.. ScientificCalculatorInterface program

Dynamic Binding example

Another Dynamic Binding example program... interface 1,2 class1 ... default method etc.


Strings..hashCode..equals etc
