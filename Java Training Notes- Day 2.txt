18/11/25:  Java Training Notes Day 2:


3 rd Normal Form :

The non-key attribute should not depend on another non-key attribute... 
we should remove the transitive dependencies..


Student(StudentId,Studentname, DeptId)

Course(CourseId, Coursename)

Department(DeptId, DeptName)

StudentCourse(StudentId, CourseId)


ACID Properties: we do Normalization to achieve ACID Properties

In this example, StudentId, CourseId both are composite keys.

DeptId is a non-key dependent on StudentId

Deptname is dependent on deptId.. here both are non-keys.. so transitive dependency is there here..

we should remove that transitive dependency




Super Key: It is a set of all combinations which shows the attribute uniquely.. like primary key + alternate key,
primary key + candidate key etc.


For the above example, mam is saying, DeptId should be in CourseId not in Student Id.. bcoz the student can study many department courses like cse student studying ece also...

so, mam said deptId should be in course table. she said this to maintain it in 1 NF.. or else, more dept id will come and it will not be in 1 NF

But, one person said, only one dept he belongs right, so can we keep in Student table or in both table


Pranay said, we can keep an Attribute Stream Id in the Student Table( The main department 





Example: 

Topics: 

DDL : Create, drop, alter

DML : Insert, update, delete

TCL : Commit, Rollback, savepoint

DCL : Grant and Revoke


Constraints



DDL and DML commands:


DML: over the data , but not change the structure... DDL define the structure..


------------DDL Commands----------------------

Create: 

-- Create a new user
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

-- Grant all privileges to the user on all databases
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

-- Apply changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Then, close and open MySQL workbench again, give + symbol again and give name 'virat' in 2 places, places where root is there...  then, give the password you gave in the query 



Grant and Revoke:  

Changing a new user


Create a new user
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

-- Grant all privileges to the user on all databases
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

-- Apply changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
