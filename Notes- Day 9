26/11 : Java Training  - Notes Day 9


Bridge Design Pattern:


Example: Video - Youtube , Netflix, Prime

All have 4k, 8k , HD etc.

But there is a Processing class with 4K, 8K,HD ..

We use ProceesingQuality interface  and Video interface

Composition: making one class's thing in another class



Proxy:  

It is like proxy server


Payment : Net banking, UPI ,cc, Cash payment (Real)..

The first three are Proxy


Composition: CashPayment is used in UPI and NetBanking classes..



So, here, Interface called payment with pay method

The classes NetBanking and UPIBanking implements the Payment

there is pay method in these classes also..


But CashPayment is actual one... so, we are creating Cash object in the two Classes NetBanking and UPIBanking... and then calling cash.pay()..


In the  main method, we are writing parent interface reference assigned to derived class object...

Payment reference to Upi and Netbanking objects..



Immutable class Creation:


The Immutable classes in Java are String, Wrapper classes , LocalDateTime etc.


Collection:

A Collection is a group of objects.

Arrays also is a basic collection only but drawbacks are:

i) Homogenous

ii) 



Iterable is extended by Collection interface.


Collection contains List , Queue , Set

List: ArrayList, LinkedList, vector, Stack

Queue: PriorityQueue, Dequeue


Map: Map does not come in Iterable.. we can't iterate a map.. directly we can't use iterator it to iterate a map.

Convert it to a set or list like that an then iterate


In Collections, there are three things there:

1.Collection

2. Collection Interface

3. Collection class in Util class



Some classes are there from Java version 1 itself.. Those are called as Legacy classes.

1. Vector , Stack , HashTable are all legacy classes.



Set: 

List:

List is an Interface

List Interface methods:


ArrayList:
  It's an Implementation class to List Interface

  -> collection of objects

  -> Duplicates allowed

  -> Maintains Insertion order

  -> Used if our frequent operation is retrieval operation as it implements Random..  Interface

   ->The Integer, String or whatever we are adding are not like primitive int etc..  They are objects... bcoz it is collection of Objects

   If we add an integer, It is Wrapped by Integer class.


  -> We can't put System.out.println(alist[])... 

    Bcoz, it's dynamic Resizable array...also, It is a class. so, classname. methodname we should put



Comparable - used for only one level of Sorting

Comparator is used when we have many levels of sorting. When we should do branch wise, then name, then salary wise... comparable can't be used...then name wise you put



LinkedList:


Node:

two parts: data and address of another node .. which is next of type Node


head=null -> no linked list



offerLast: insert at last place



Double -ended queue: 2 front , 2 back are there


We don't use search in linkedlist operation...


It's is best choice for frequent insertion and deletion... bcoz not continuous memory



Vector:

- Has Synchronization

- Multithreads will be there

- Many threads will be there... it makes other threads wait and make it complete the performing thread.. It puts lock to all..

This condition is called Race condition.



HashSet:

Hashing:
 For Search operation, we will go here

  
We store the data in HashTable... we store using Hash function

Let there be table of size 10. 45%10 =5.. 72%10=2





//duplicate values are not allowed
 -> but it will not show any error
-> it gets replaced with the same value


-> no random access... so, get method won't work

//Normal for loop not possible.. bcoz no indexing is there..

so the advanced for loop is possible


Linked Hash Set: Linked List + Hash Table

Actually, when 45, 75 are there... we will go to the next index there... linear probing we do


But, when we form a linked list and store it on the same row, it is called Linked HashSet.


TreeSet: TreeSet maintains the order

so, when you give homogenous data, it will sort as usual

But, when you give heterogenous data, it does n't know by what means , it should compare..


Tree Set uses Red-Black tree

This tree uses BST logic




My doubts:

1. Abstract class vs Interface

2. Why Cash is not used as Abstract class in Proxy pattern

3. Today's first pattern

4. Immutable classes.. why no setters...what is the use of these classes..why constructors should be used

5. Collection is class or Interface..Iterable is??


6. Generics concept doubt


7. Linked List code one doubt

8. LinkedList pop vs peek

9. forEach is from which FunctionalInterface??

10. Red Black Trees

11. Enumeration

12. Entry

13. why on ValueSet on Map, new HashMap(object) is created?


Map:
 Map<K,V>

 Map does not have iterators

 Map is not from the collection...so no add method is there..Rest all have add method

we go for put method


TreeMap : Follows Sorted Order


//HashMap works on HashTable principle... But Enumeration not works for them.. we convert to Set and do.


Question :

1. Create 5 students, add into treeset, and then print the info 

2. TreeMap<Employee,Department> ... how do we insert the data?  Try on own
