----------Software Engineering----------------------

Changing Requirements
Environmental Shifts

Error correction and quality improvement
Business needs and regulations



Software models:

4.Increment

5.Agile - 


Sprint based targets

Waterflow model was basic and old...taken all requirements and doing

Process adopter - 


The Software Engineering life cycle(SDLC):

- Planning
- Analysis

- Design
- Implementation

- Testing & Integration
- Maintenance
rrr


functional and non - functional requirements:



Planning and Analysis:

- Define Objectves
- Scope and budget

- Risk Identification
-Feasibility study

- Output -> project plan




Requirement Analysis:

- Functional Requirements - must be present definitely in the feature
-Non- functional requirements - may or may not be present
- Use cases and user stories

- Output - > SRS document - Software Requirements



Design and Prototyping:

DFD - data flow diagram

we have DFD symbols






Project Management:




ER Model:


Entity , Attribute , Relationship


Entity Set


Strong Entity and Weak Entity:


The Entity which depends on another entity are weak entity.. represented by double rectangle


Composite Attribute:

Address has Street , city, state, country etc.


Multivalued attribute- Phone No

Derived attribute - Age



Unary/Recursive Relationship:

Binary relationship:


Ternary:

N-ary:





ER- Diagram:

Employee:  


Attribute Diagram

ER Diagram

Partial Attribute , partial Entities, we will speak in DTOs





Query Clauses:

1.Offset

2.Distinct

3. Join


like , 


Group By:  To group the values of a column..  

if after that, we want any particular details, use 'Having'.


Question: write query to fetch all records having their email as gmail.


Question: Retrieve all the records of the customers with the corresponding SalesRep information
