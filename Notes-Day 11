Java Training Notes - Day 11

Different types of IO Streams:


Byte Stream : InputStream and OutputStream


DemoOnIOStream Program:

1. This fileReader comes in IO Exception, not ByteStream

2. throwsIO Exception:

parent of FileNotFound Exception.. so, we can give IOException itself


3.writer.write() will overwrite the content...so to add some new content, put writer.append()

4.






Difference between CharacterStream and ByteStream is:

we can give only textual data in characterstream but in ByteStream we can give images, objects, any type of data



If we 



// Without S




JDBC:


Converting Java codes to Database

JDBC Architecture:


JDBC Driver:


Type 1: JDBC - ODBC Driver

In the control panel,windows tool,  odbc -> Driver -> the details are there


Type 2 - Java Native API

These will communicate with the database


Type 3 - Java to Network Protocol


Third party vendors will be there

They will provide database related APIs


Type 4 - Java to Database protocol


We are using this

Driver we use is  in the MySQL - connector...


// Driver manager creates connection and job is done for us.

// 



Simple statements:


1.executeQuery()
2. executeUpdate()


JDBC:


//JDBC Program:

App.java:


1. That queries number 1,2,3,4 should be the correct column order in the table of the database

2. 2 ways to execute the queries.. 



CRUD Operations:



Thread:

Why 2 methods we use: extends Thread

implements Runnable...





Prgm 3 - BankThread :


1. mam is saying , like user1 , user2 withdraws randomly, but next balance statement, we don't know, it is for whom...so we use synchronized

synchronized can be used at method level. . after thread 1 completes it's execution fully, thread2 executes..


2. muTex: 

3. we don't need to put Synchronized for whole method..inside a method, for a particular block, i.e critical section alone, we can put synchronized




SDLC:

1. Planning

2. Requirements

   Functional : Both Frontend and Backend should be in coincidence

   Non- Functional : speed checks, quality checks, security checks, Encrypted or not like that we will check

3. Design

	
4. Devolopment: Devolopment and Unit Testing

5. Testing:

   Unit testing

   Integration testing

   UAT

   Regression Testing: Again they rerun the application and check whether all are working correctly or not

   Performance Testing



6. Deployment : 

   Big bang

   Phased 

   Parallel- Already few things are there. 


7. Maintainence  

   Corrective

   Adaptive - we use different OS.. we check whether it adapts

   Perfective

   Preventive



SDLC Models:

Waterfall Model - Linear and Sequential model

Agile model - Iterative and Incremental model

We use Sprints here

We use this when requirements are changing


Spiral model - 

V - model : Extension of Waterfall model, plus Verification and validation of each phase

Prototype model - 

   

Project Manaagement :

They will check whether software is managed on time..


	


Questions:

1. Implement a scenario that uses multithreading that assumes   number of chefs as threads ,and manages chefs to complete the orders of the restaurant
