Java Training -Notes Day 8

ZonedDateTime


Generics:

The main reason for usage of Generics is Collections



Question: Craete an order class which accepts orders of different type of data

i) give one item
ii) give array of items... use the same order class for both

Copied from Properties to the Build in the pom. xml file to change the JRE version to 17



Question: 


Generics on Methods:


<T> , <K,V> are over... rest of them we will see later in collections





Design Patterns:


Creational Design Patterns

Structural Design Patterns

Behavioural Design Patterns


Creational : 4 types


Singleton: If 1000 clients are establishing DB connections separately, cost will be high

so,same instances will be used again....




Factory pattern: some features will be common and we use 


Bean - Singleton Pattern


Spring- @Application Context , and other and all.. use Factory pattern



Abstract Factory pattern:

Factory of Factories

Clouds are the best example of this



Builder Pattern:

Sometimes we need to separately define the data members using n-different constructors... we use build method to do this..


For many optional Fields, we use this...

we create the base one..then we use other one..



Template Pattern:  Parentclass reference to child class object


DrinkMaker, some methods are there... some  methods will change...so coffeemaker and teamaker... coffeemaker has some overridden methods..

teamaker has some overridden methods


The Singelton pattern works for Single threaded environment only... For Multithreaded environment, we should use synchronized keyword.



Assignment Questions:

1. Design patterns 



Morning:

ZonalTime -  10 + functions worked out with a program

Generics - concept explained briefly

Then 2 prgms

i) Container, DemoOnGenerics, Student

ii) DemoOnGenerics, Pair,Order,Item


Morning after Break:



DemoOnGenerics


Afternoon:

Design Patterns - 4 types  and Programs
